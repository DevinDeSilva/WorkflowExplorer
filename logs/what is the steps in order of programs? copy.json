        "summary": "The steps in order of the programs identified in the system are primarily determined by sorting based on their identifiers, which serve to denote the sequence of execution. Here's the ordered list based on the obtained identifiers:\n\n1. **System Prompt Template Generator** (ID: 1): This program generates a system prompt based on the provided dataset structure and user input. [URI: http://testwebsite/testProgram#system_prompt_generator]\n\n2. **Information Extractor** (ID: 2): This program extracts entities or relevant information from the generated text using specified instructions. [URI: http://testwebsite/testProgram#information_extractor]\n\n3. **Batch SPARQL Query Extractor / Data Frame Combiner / SPARQL Query Builder** (ID: 3): These programs are simultaneously listed because they share the same identifier. \n   - **Batch SPARQL Query Extractor** extracts information about the entities from the knowledge graph in batch mode. [URI: http://testwebsite/testProgram#batch_sparql_query_extractor]\n   - **Data Frame Combiner** combines multiple data frames resulting from SPARQL queries into a single data frame. [URI: http://testwebsite/testProgram#DF_combine]\n   - **SPARQL Query Builder** builds SPARQL queries to extract information about the entities from the knowledge graph. [URI: http://testwebsite/testProgram#sparql_query_extractor]\n\n4. **Query Result Post-Processor** (ID: 4): This program post-processes the query results from the knowledge graph. [URI: http://testwebsite/testProgram#query_result_post_processor]\n\nThese steps reflect the sequence in which the programs operate within the system, ensuring that the data flows through each stage as intended, with outputs from one stage potentially serving as inputs for the next. The inclusion of times and matching identifiers assists in maintaining this orderly flow. \n\n**Important Facts (URIs):**\n- http://testwebsite/testProgram#system_prompt_generator\n- http://testwebsite/testProgram#information_extractor\n- http://testwebsite/testProgram#batch_sparql_query_extractor\n- http://testwebsite/testProgram#DF_combine\n- http://testwebsite/testProgram#sparql_query_extractor\n- http://testwebsite/testProgram#query_result_post_processor",

[URI: http://testwebsite/testProgram#information_extractor]\n\n3. **Batch SPARQL Query Extractor / Data Frame Combiner / SPARQL Query Builder** (ID: 3): These programs are simultaneously listed because they share the same identifier. \n   - **Batch SPARQL Query Extractor** extracts information about the entities from the knowledge graph in batch mode. [URI: http://testwebsite/testProgram#batch_sparql_query_extractor]\n   - **Data Frame Combiner** combines multiple data frames resulting from SPARQL queries into a single data frame. [URI: http://testwebsite/testProgram#DF_combine]\n   - **SPARQL Query Builder** builds SPARQL queries to extract information about the entities from the knowledge graph. [URI: http://testwebsite/testProgram#sparql_query_extractor]\n\n4. **Query Result Post-Processor** (ID: 4): This program post-processes the query results from the knowledge graph. [URI: http://testwebsite/testProgram#query_result_post_processor]\n\nThese steps reflect the sequence in which the programs operate within the system, ensuring that the data flows through each stage as intended, with outputs from one stage potentially serving as inputs for the next.
