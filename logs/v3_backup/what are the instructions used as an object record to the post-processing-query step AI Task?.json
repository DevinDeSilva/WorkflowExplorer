Here are the specific instructions:\n\n1. **Formatting Instruction**: The result rows should be concatenated into a single row for each column using a '|' as the concatenation marker. This format provides a unified view, ensuring data from each row is combined as specified.\n\n2. **Processing Instruction**: In case of duplicate ingredients, the instruction is to select the row with the most information particularly in the `sugarG` and `ingredientCat` columns. Additionally, missing values are to be filled such that zeroes fill in `sugarG` and dashes ('-') in `ingredientCat`.\n\nThese instructions guide the post-processing step, ensuring consistent formatting and handling of specific data scenarios, which improves data quality and usability in downstream processes. \n\nThe URIs of the important facts that were mainly responsible for shaping this explanation are:\n\n- **Formatting Instruction URI**: No explicit URI provided, but it's related to the value `\"Concat all the rows into single row at each column by '|' concatenation marker. @en^^<xsd:string>\"`\n  \n- **Processing Instruction URI**: No explicit URI provided, but relates to the value `\"If there are duplicate ingredients then select row with most information on `sugarG` and `ingredientCat` columns. Fill all the missing values with '0' in `sugarG` column and with '-' in 'ingredientCat` column.@en^^<xsd:string>\"`\n\nAdditionally, the process pertains to the entity:\n- **Post-processing AI Task URI**: `http://testwebsite/testProgram#AI_Task-query_result_post_processor` \n\nThese instructions serve as references ensuring the post-processing step occurs as outlined.",

Here are the specific instructions:\n\n1. **Formatting Instruction**: The result rows should be concatenated into a single row for each column using a '|' as the concatenation marker. This format provides a unified view, ensuring data from each row is combined as specified.\n\n2. **Processing Instruction**: In case of duplicate ingredients, the instruction is to select the row with the most information particularly in the `sugarG` and `ingredientCat` columns. Additionally, missing values are to be filled such that zeroes fill in `sugarG` and dashes ('-') in `ingredientCat`.\n\nThese instructions guide the post-processing step, ensuring consistent formatting and handling of specific data scenarios, which improves data quality and usability in downstream processes. \n\nThe URIs of the important facts that were mainly responsible for shaping this explanation are:\n\n- **Formatting Instruction URI**: No explicit URI provided, but it's related to the value `\"Concat all the rows into single row at each column by '|' concatenation marker. @en^^<xsd:string>\"`\n  \n- **Processing Instruction URI**: No explicit URI provided, but relates to the value `\"If there are duplicate ingredients then select row with most information on `sugarG` and `ingredientCat` columns. Fill all the missing values with '0' in `sugarG` column and with '-' in 'ingredientCat` column.@en^^<xsd:string>\"`\n\nAdditionally, the process pertains to the entity:\n- **Post-processing AI Task URI**: `http://testwebsite/testProgram#AI_Task-query_result_post_processor` \n\nThese instructions serve as references ensuring the post-processing step occurs as outlined."
