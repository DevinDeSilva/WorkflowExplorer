To identify this, we need to examine the inputs and attributes associated with the 'sparql_query_extractor' task, as they may include references to specific technologies or frameworks used.\n\nFrom the previously gathered results, several important points can be highlighted:\n\n1. **AI Task Identification**: The 'sparql_query_extractor' AI task is one of several AI tasks identified, with a specific URI: `http://testwebsite/testProgram#AI_Task-sparql_query_extractor`.\n\n2. **Inputs to the AI Task**: \n   - The inputs mentioned for this AI task are an 'endpoint' and a 'sparql_query_template'.\n   - The 'endpoint' input contains the value: `https://dbpedia.org/sparql`, which suggests it connects to the DBpedia SPARQL endpoint configured for English language queries.\n   - The 'sparql_query_template' input is a detailed SPARQL query script designed to extract certain data related to ingredients and their properties from DBpedia.\n\n3. **Absence of Builder LLM Information**: The examination of inputs and object record attributes does not directly reveal any information that would denote a specific builder LLM being used. Thus, it appears that there are no explicit references to a builder LLM in the provided attributes for this particular task. Builder LLMs, when present, are typically noted through specific attributes or values that recognize the language model or library in use; however, no such details have been surfaced here.\n\nConclusion: Based on the information provided, the builder LLM used as an object record for the 'sparql_query_extraction' AI task is not specified in the data. The available records primarily describe inputs like endpoints and SPARQL query structures but do not reference any large language models.\n\n**Important URIs:**\n- `http://testwebsite/testProgram#AI_Task-sparql_query_extractor`\n- `http://testwebsite/testProgram#AI_Task-sparql_query_extractor-Input-endpoint`\n- `http://testwebsite/testProgram#AI_Task-sparql_query_extractor-Input-sparql_query_template`\n\nThese URIs highlight the tasks and inputs in question but do not directly relate to any builder LLM specifics.",
