        "summary": "To address the main question, \"What are the AI Tasks that generated programs?\" let's first understand the context based on the previous results from the knowledge graph queries.\n\nWe identified a set of AI tasks present in the system, each corresponding to an AI Task within the system:\n1. AI_Task-DF_combine\n2. AI_Task-Pipeline\n3. AI_Task-batch_sparql_query_extractor\n4. AI_Task-information_extractor\n5. AI_Task-llm_chat\n6. AI_Task-query_result_post_processor\n7. AI_Task-sparql_query_extractor\n8. AI_Task-system_prompt_generator\n\nEach of these AI tasks has generated specific output programs. Here's the mapping of AI tasks to their corresponding output programs:\n- \"AI_Task-DF_combine\" generated the program \"DF_combine\".\n- \"AI_Task-Pipeline\" generated the program \"Pipeline\".\n- \"AI_Task-batch_sparql_query_extractor\" generated the program \"batch_sparql_query_extractor\".\n- \"AI_Task-information_extractor\" generated the program \"information_extractor\".\n- \"AI_Task-llm_chat\" generated the program \"llm_chat\".\n- \"AI_Task-query_result_post_processor\" generated the program \"query_result_post_processor\".\n- \"AI_Task-sparql_query_extractor\" generated the program \"sparql_query_extractor\".\n- \"AI_Task-system_prompt_generator\" generated the program \"system_prompt_generator\".\n\nThus, all the identified AI tasks in the system have generated their respective output programs. This indicates each task has a direct association with a program output which they are responsible for creating or defining.\n\nImportant facts that mainly influenced this explanation are the mappings of AI tasks to their output programs. Here are the URIs of the important facts:\n- AI_Task-DF_combine \u2192 Program: DF_combine (http://testwebsite/testProgram#DF_combine)\n- AI_Task-Pipeline \u2192 Program: Pipeline (http://testwebsite/testProgram#Pipeline)\n- AI_Task-batch_sparql_query_extractor \u2192 Program: batch_sparql_query_extractor (http://testwebsite/testProgram#batch_sparql_query_extractor)\n- AI_Task-information_extractor \u2192 Program: information_extractor (http://testwebsite/testProgram#information_extractor)\n- AI_Task-llm_chat \u2192 Program: llm_chat (http://testwebsite/testProgram#llm_chat)\n- AI_Task-query_result_post_processor \u2192 Program: query_result_post_processor (http://testwebsite/testProgram#query_result_post_processor)\n- AI_Task-sparql_query_extractor \u2192 Program: sparql_query_extractor (http://testwebsite/testProgram#sparql_query_extractor)\n- AI_Task-system_prompt_generator \u2192 Program: system_prompt_generator (http://testwebsite/testProgram#system_prompt_generator)\n\nThese AI tasks are each associated with a specific type (\"https://purl.org/heals/eo#AITask\") which classifies them as AI tasks within the system. This classification and their program associations answer the main question about which AI tasks led to the generation of these programs.",

    "final_answer": "To address the main question, \"What are the AI Tasks that generated programs?\" let's first understand the context based on the previous results from the knowledge graph queries.\n\nWe identified a set of AI tasks present in the system, each corresponding to an AI Task within the system:\n1. AI_Task-DF_combine\n2. AI_Task-Pipeline\n3. AI_Task-batch_sparql_query_extractor\n4. AI_Task-information_extractor\n5. AI_Task-llm_chat\n6. AI_Task-query_result_post_processor\n7. AI_Task-sparql_query_extractor\n8. AI_Task-system_prompt_generator\n\nEach of these AI tasks has generated specific output programs. Here's the mapping of AI tasks to their corresponding output programs:\n- \"AI_Task-DF_combine\" generated the program \"DF_combine\".\n- \"AI_Task-Pipeline\" generated the program \"Pipeline\".\n- \"AI_Task-batch_sparql_query_extractor\" generated the program \"batch_sparql_query_extractor\".\n- \"AI_Task-information_extractor\" generated the program \"information_extractor\".\n- \"AI_Task-llm_chat\" generated the program \"llm_chat\".\n- \"AI_Task-query_result_post_processor\" generated the program \"query_result_post_processor\".\n- \"AI_Task-sparql_query_extractor\" generated the program \"sparql_query_extractor\".\n- \"AI_Task-system_prompt_generator\" generated the program \"system_prompt_generator\".\n\nThus, all the identified AI tasks in the system have generated their respective output programs. This indicates each task has a direct association with a program output which they are responsible for creating or defining.\n\nImportant facts that mainly influenced this explanation are the mappings of AI tasks to their output programs. Here are the URIs of the important facts:\n- AI_Task-DF_combine \u2192 Program: DF_combine (http://testwebsite/testProgram#DF_combine)\n- AI_Task-Pipeline \u2192 Program: Pipeline (http://testwebsite/testProgram#Pipeline)\n- AI_Task-batch_sparql_query_extractor \u2192 Program: batch_sparql_query_extractor (http://testwebsite/testProgram#batch_sparql_query_extractor)\n- AI_Task-information_extractor \u2192 Program: information_extractor (http://testwebsite/testProgram#information_extractor)\n- AI_Task-llm_chat \u2192 Program: llm_chat (http://testwebsite/testProgram#llm_chat)\n- AI_Task-query_result_post_processor \u2192 Program: query_result_post_processor (http://testwebsite/testProgram#query_result_post_processor)\n- AI_Task-sparql_query_extractor \u2192 Program: sparql_query_extractor (http://testwebsite/testProgram#sparql_query_extractor)\n- AI_Task-system_prompt_generator \u2192 Program: system_prompt_generator (http://testwebsite/testProgram#system_prompt_generator)\n\nThese AI tasks are each associated with a specific type (\"https://purl.org/heals/eo#AITask\") which classifies them as AI tasks within the system. This classification and their program associations answer the main question about which AI tasks led to the generation of these programs."
